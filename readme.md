# HELLO PROFESSOR!! THIS IS MY MIDTERM PROJECT!!

## ADVANCED PYTHON CALCULATOR FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING GRADUATE COURSE.

## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

THE DESIGN OF THIS PROJECT IS IMPLEMENTED USING: 

1. [COMMAND - LINE INTERFACE ( REPL )](#1-command-line-interface--repl-) <br/>
    - [Execution of Arithmetic operations:](#execution-of-arithmetic-operations) <br/>
        - [Addition](#1-addition) <br/>
        - [Subtraction](#2-subtraction) <br/>
        - [Multiplication](#3-multiplication) <br/>
        - [Division](#4-division) <br/>
    - [History Management:]
2. PLUGIN SYSTEM <br/>
3. CALCULATION HISTORY MANAGEMENT WITH PANDAS <br/>
4. PROFESSIONAL LOGGING PRACTICES <br/>
5. ADVANCED DATA HANDLING WITH PANDAS <br/>
6. DESIGN PATTERNS FOR SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE <br/>
7. CONFIGURATION VIA ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br/>


## **1. COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE ( REPL )**

~ The **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** is used for direct interaction with the calculator in real-time. REPL is used for: 

#### ~ Execution of Arithmetic operations: Performs add, subtract, multiply and divide operations.

- [Addition](#1-addition) <br/>
- [Subtraction](#2-subtraction) <br/>
- [Multiplication](#3-multiplication) <br/>
- [Division](#4-division) <br/>


##### 1. **Addition:** 
- Sum of Two numbers is performed. 
- Errors are handled using try & except block if arises. 
- The program is designed to take two arguments and raises a error if more than two are given. 
- The user is asked for input, if arguments are not given.

##### 2. **Subtraction:** 
- Difference of Two numbers is performed. 
- Errors are handled using try & except block if arises. 
- The program is designed to take two arguments and raises a error if more than two are given. 
- The user is asked for input, if arguments are not given.

##### 3. **Multiplication:** 
- Product of Two numbers is performed. 
- Errors are handled using try & except block if arises. 
- The program is designed to take two arguments and raises a error if more than two are given. 
- The user is asked for input, if arguments are not given.

##### 4. **Division:** 
- Quotient of Two numbers is performed. 
- Errors are handled using try & except block if arises. 
- The program is designed to take two arguments and raises a error if more than two are given. 
- The user is asked for input, if arguments are not given.

#### ~ History Management: Saves, loads, clears and deletes the operations performed.

- [Save History](#1-save-history)
- [Load History](#2-load-history)
- [Clear History]
- [Delete History]

##### 1. **Save History:**
-  This stores the history of operations performed.
