# HELLO PROFESSOR!! THIS IS MY MIDTERM PROJECT!!

## ADVANCED PYTHON CALCULATOR FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING GRADUATE COURSE.

## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

THE DESIGN OF THIS PROJECT IS IMPLEMENTED USING: 

[1. COMMAND - LINE INTERFACE ( REPL )](#1-command-line-interface--repl-)
2. PLUGIN SYSTEM
3. CALCULATION HISTORY MANAGEMENT WITH PANDAS
4. PROFESSIONAL LOGGING PRACTICES
5. ADVANCED DATA HANDLING WITH PANDAS
6. DESIGN PATTERNS FOR SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE
7. CONFIGURATION VIA ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES


## **1. COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE ( REPL )**

~ The **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** is used for direct interaction with the calculator in real-time. REPL is used for: 

##### Execution of Arithmetic operations:

1. **Addition:** 
- Sum of Two numbers is performed. 
- Errors are handled using try & except block if arises. 
- The program is designed to take two arguments and raises a error if more than two are given. 
- The user is asked for input, if arguments are not given.

2. **Subtraction:** 
- Difference of Two numbers is performed. 
- Errors are handled using try & except block if arises. 
- The program is designed to take two arguments and raises a error if more than two are given. 
- The user is asked for input, if arguments are not given.
